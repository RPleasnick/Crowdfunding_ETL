# Crowdfunding_ETL
Project 2

This is a collaborative effort of Alexander King and Renee Pleasnick.

**OVERVIEW**

This code builds an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and regular expressions to extract and transform data.  Four CSV files (_campaign.csv, category.csv, subcategory.csv, caontacts.csv_) were created.  Using these files, an ERD and table schema were created. As illustrated in _crowdfunding_db_schema.sql_.  

Using pgAdmin, crowdfunding_db was created.  Please see file _crowdfunding_db.png_.  Tables for the csv files were created in crowdfunding_db using Azure Studio.
Once the tables were created, the csv files were imported into them using pgAdmin.  This was verified by running SELECT statements for each table.  Please see _crowdfunding_db_schema.sql_, _crowdfunding_db_schema.sql, crowdfunding_db_schema.sql_.
